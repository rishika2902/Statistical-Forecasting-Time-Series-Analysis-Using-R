This project explores statistical forecasting techniques using R, focusing on time series analysis and predictive modeling. The key components include:

âœ… Data Exploration & Preprocessing: Understanding trends, seasonality, and patterns in time series data.

âœ… Regression Modeling: Building predictive models using statistical regression techniques.

âœ… Batch Forecasting: Automating forecast generation for multiple datasets.

âœ… ARIMA Modeling: Implementing the AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model for time series forecasting.

âœ… Manual Forecasting Models: Developing custom forecasting models to analyze different approaches.

ðŸ“Œ Tech Stack: R, ggplot2, dplyr, tidymodels, forecast, caret
